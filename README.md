# Cybersecurity Learning

This repository documents my practical cybersecurity learning journey using Kali Linux.

I am learning by doing — not only watching videos — and building small tools and scripts to understand how real systems and networks work.

---

## What I Practice

• Linux terminal and permissions  
• Networking fundamentals (IP, ports, ICMP, TCP)  
• Bash scripting  
• Python scripting for security  
• Sockets and communication between machines  
• Simple scanners and enumeration

## Folder Structure

python/  → Python practice and security scripts  
bash/    → Bash scripts (like IP sweep)  
notes/   → Learning notes and observations

---

## Lab Practice

All testing is done in a private virtual lab environment (Kali Linux + vulnerable machines such as Kioptrix).  
No real systems are targeted.

---

## Goal

My goal is to combine software development and cybersecurity so I can both:
1. Build secure applications
2. Understand how attackers actually think and operate
